## Question 2
How can we use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

## Answer 2
* B (Behavior): This is the thing we want someone to do, like exercising or eating well.

* M (Motivation): How much the person wants to do it. If they really want to, it's easier.

* A (Ability): How easy or hard it is to do. If it's easy, they're more likely to do it.

* P (Prompt): Something that reminds them to do it. Like a message or feeling.

By applying the B=MAP model, we're getting motivation, ability, and prompts to make new habit easier to adopt.We need to remember that consistency is key to habit formation, so we need to be patient and persistent. Over time, the habit will become more automatic, and we won't rely as heavily on motivation and prompts to maintain it.
