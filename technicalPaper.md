# Technical Paper: Javascript

## Abstract
JavaScript is a widely used programming language known for its flexibility in handling various data types and structures. This paper shows fundamental data types and data structures in JavaScript, like numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and their examples.

## 1. Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and versatile programming language that provides various data types and data structures for their developers. Understanding these basics is essential for effective usage of JavaScript language.

## 2. Basic Data Types

### 2.1. Numbers
In JavaScript, numbers can be integers or floating-point values. Numeric operations are very common:

```javascript
let integerNumber = 12;
let floatingNumber = 3.14;

let sum = integerNumber + floatingNumber;
console.log(sum);  // Output: 15.14
```
## 2.2. Strings
Strings represent text and they are enclosed in single or double quotes. We can do various operations using Strings.

```` javascript
let firstName = 'Mohd';
let lastName = 'Shafi';

let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
console.log(fullName);  // Output: "Mohd Shafi"
````

## 3.Data Structures

### 3.1 Arrays 
Arrays are used to store various data types. They are dynamic in nature and they are versatile and frequently used:

````javascript
let cities = ['Banglore', 'Hyderabad', 'Delhi'];
colors.push('Mumbai');  // Add an element to the end
console.log(colors[1]);  // Output: "Hyderabad"
````

### 3.2 Objects
Objects are key-value pairs just like map, making them suitable for storing structured data:

````javascript
let person = {
    firstName: 'Mohd',
    lastName: 'Shafi',
    age: 23
};

console.log(person.secondName);  // Output: "Shafi"

````

## 4. Conclusion
This paper has provided an overview of basic data types and data structures in JavaScript, offering code samples to show their usage. Understanding these fundamentals is important to learn any programming language like javascript.
